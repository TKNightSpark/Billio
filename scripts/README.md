## macOS Installation Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

This app requires the following dependencies installed on your Mac:

- **GTK3** (for the GUI)
- **LibreOffice** (for converting ODT to PDF)

### 2. Install Dependencies

You have two options to install the dependencies:

---

### Option A: Manual Installation

#### Install Homebrew (if you don’t have it)
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

#### Install GTK3 via Homebrew
```bash
brew install gtk+3
```

#### Install LibreOffice

Download the latest macOS LibreOffice from https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/

**OR**

Install via Homebrew (may not be the latest version):

```bash
brew install libreoffice
```

Make sure LibreOffice is installed in `/Applications/LibreOffice.app` or the `soffice` CLI is available.

---

### Option B: Automated Script

You can use the provided `install_deps_mac.sh` script to automate Homebrew dependency installation.

#### Run the script

Make sure the script is executable:
```bash
chmod +x install_deps_mac.sh
```

Run it:
```bash
./install_deps_mac.sh
```

**Note:** The script installs GTK3 via Homebrew. It will check if LibreOffice is installed and prompt you to install it manually if missing, because LibreOffice installation is large and usually done via a GUI installer.

---

### 3. Running the App

After installing dependencies:

Open the app bundle generated by py2app (e.g., `dist/gui_gnome.app`):
```bash
open dist/gui_gnome.app
```

---

### 4. Troubleshooting

If the app fails to start because it cannot locate GTK3 libraries:

Ensure Homebrew’s bin paths are included, e.g.:
```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH" # or /opt/homebrew/bin for Apple Silicon Macs
```

You might need to restart your terminal or system.

If PDF generation fails:

Verify `soffice` CLI is functional:
```bash
/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice --version
```
